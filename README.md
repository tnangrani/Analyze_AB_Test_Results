# Analyze_AB_Test_Results
This Udacity project is focued on the application of practical statistical techniques (probability analysis and regression) to analyse and interpret the results from A/B testing. The data set consists of conversion rates between the old and new webpages from an e-commerce website.

The analysis is performed and presented within a Jupyter notebook (also saved as PDF and HTML), and meets the following objectives:
- Investigate and clean the data for analysis;
- Apply statistical and probability testing techniques including hypothesis testing, simulation and logistic regression;
- Correct interpretation of statistical outputs (p-values, z-scores, one/two-tail tests); and
- Effective statement of conclusion, including both statistical and practical reasoning.

## Files
- "ab_data.csv" and "countries.csv" are raw data files used for the analysis
- "ab_clean.csv" is the cleaned output of the "ab_data.csv" data file
- "Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb" is the Jupyter Notebook file consisting of the Python code
- "Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.pdf" is the PDF version on the Jupyter Notebook
- "Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.html" is the HTML version of the Jupyter Notebook
